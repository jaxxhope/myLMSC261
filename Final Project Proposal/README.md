#Final Project Proposal

For my final project I will be using the program Glowscript that we used in our most recent class to recreate this 3D Solar System Animation following this youtube video as a guide

#Problem Solving

This project will allow me to create objects using the Glowscript program
#Use Cases

Can be used by others interested and possibly those observing the finished product
#Timeline
- Week of 3/29 project proposal approval/feedback
- week of 4/5 meet with Rachel/Maya to get more feedback and guidance on my project and make sure I'm heading in the right direction + discuss any trouble shooting
- week of 3/12 and on complete project and do work here and there until complete
#Assessment

Can be assessed by observing how well I constructed the solar system and the programs/code's efficiency as well as the overall execution and timing of the project as a whole
