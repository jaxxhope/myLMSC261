#Running into issues
- First the group and I had to recall how to merge and make our branches functional
- once we got that figured out Connor attempted to use CSS
- we then figured out that we had to change the format to html 5 after Rachel came to visit us
- we had to refresh out minds on how branches work and how to operate within the brances
#Decisions made
- we decided decide roles
- once we decided upon roles we went ahead and did our individual work on the assignment and made headway
#Self-Assessment
- I feel that I did what was required of me for this assignment and pitched in when I had input or was able to attempt to help someone else
- I wrote the my artist bio and added a gif to my portion of the site which I enjoyed
#Group Assessment
- I think everyone in my group did very well, Connor led the group very well and we all contributing I would say and did our part to complete the assignment to the best of our ability
